## Advanced workshop on XGBoost 

Tianqi Chen will be in Santa Monica, June 2, 2016 and besides a 
[meetup talk in the evening](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/xgboost-a-scalable-tree-boosting-system-tickets-25443090970) 
(already sold out, sorry)
I'm also organizing an advanced workshop in the afternoon (3:30-5:30pm in Santa Monica) to do more advanced stuff.
There will be only 10 spots for the workshop and you'll have to 
[apply by filling out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14rlZFGKBOblu-ynuHp3ev-wrhZqSHQpiHeyjuaVKqN4/viewform?edit_requested=true).

The workshop will be a mix of Tianqi talking about more advanced stuff and participants interacting, asking questions etc. (partly hands-on, bring your laptop and your specific questions/problems/datasets). We can use this github repo (issues, PR) for setting up questions/problems/topics etc. to be discussed in the workshop, feel free to participate.
